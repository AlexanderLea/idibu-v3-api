### How do we stop vacancies becoming out of sync between idibu and our system?
We can add a quick plugin that creates a redirect when the user clicks ‘Add vacancy’ inside idibu - this will redirect them to your system. This will make it impossible for them to create a vacancy with any other workflow than: 
a) vacancy is created in your system b) vacancy syncs to idibu via iFrame
