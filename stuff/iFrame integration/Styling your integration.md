When you have got the integration working we can provide you with a unique partner username - this will be used to replace the “integration” default variable of “iframe”.

This will allow us to implement style overrides to make the integration match your host system. We use the LESS system which your tech team will be familiar with, so defining (for example) the system colours is very easy:

```
@negative-color: #D11F38;
@positive-color: #72BF44;
@info-color: #727F85;
@neutral-color: #0081B9;
@line-color: #DEDEDE;
@line-color-light: #f1efeb;
@brand-color: #D30E7A;
```

We can work with you to fine-tune the styling, a full CSS ruleset reference can be found here:
