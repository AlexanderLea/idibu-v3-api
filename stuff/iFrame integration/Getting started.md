We will use Bullhorn as an example of how to embed idibu using an iFrame. While the iFrame window in a system varies, the approach of idibu is to maximise the real estate space inside the given window.

Typically the area idibu will be working inside a Vacancy looks like this:

![image4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/stuff/iFrame integration/image4.png)

1. Single navigation link inside the Vacancy object to load the idibu CRM iFrame
2. idibu content loaded inside given iFrame window area

## Generating your idibu account login keys

You need to create a private application inside your idibu v3 account to generate the Secret and ID keys that will enable you to connect to the idibu system.

1. Inside your idibu account navigate to the Developer area https://v3.idibu.com/c/developer

2. Click the “Create an application” button

3. Add a name for your application and click save

4. Navigate back to https://v3.idibu.com/c/developer/

5. Record the ID and SECRET of your application
